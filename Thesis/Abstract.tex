\begin{abstract}
The internet has advanced from ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network),
an early packet-switching network and the first to implement the TCP/IP protocol, 
to become such a critical component of our development in all fronts as a species.\newline 

Perhaps the most impactful of the inventions that were enabled by the internet is the
World Wide Web, invented by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee.
Since that first Http Client-Server communication in November of 1989, the world wide web 
has changed the way we we communicate, the way we study, the way we think. The impact, and
indeed resonsibilities of the world wide web cannot be overstated. More than 90\% of
cross-border financial traactions are happening over the internet. \newline

It is critical that key resources that enable these communications and transactions
are secured from negative actors. The study, development and practice of tools and methods
necessarry for the defence of these systems is called Cyber Security.
